# Employee Directory

For this assignment you will be building an online employee directory for your company. 

There is an array of employees in the `employeeList.js` file. Note that there is only 1 html file. This is a single page application. You will need to use jQuery to hide and show sections as necessary.

Begin by creating the `app.js` file, and linking to it from `index.html`.

In `app.js` you will need to implement all of the following functionality:

1. A View option that displays all employee info:

2. An Add option that allows users to input name, office number, and phone number and then renders the updated employee list.

3. A Verify option that allows users to input a name and renders `yes` if the employee exists and `no` otherwise.

4. An Update option that allows the user to input name, office number, and phone number and updates the office number and phone number of the employee that matches the input name, and then renders the updated employee list. 

5. A Delete option that deletes the employee with the matching name nd then renders the updated employee list.
